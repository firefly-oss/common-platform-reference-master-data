## Overview

The Reference Master Data Microservice is a core component of the Firefly Platform, providing centralized management of reference data used across the platform. This microservice serves as the single source of truth for various types of master data, ensuring consistency and standardization across all platform services.

Built with a reactive architecture using Spring WebFlux and R2DBC, this microservice offers high-performance, non-blocking APIs for managing and retrieving reference data. The catalog-based design allows for flexible and dynamic configuration of reference data, making it adaptable to changing business requirements.

## Architecture

The Reference Master Data Microservice follows a reactive microservice architecture pattern:

- **Reactive Programming**: Built on Spring WebFlux and Project Reactor for non-blocking I/O operations
- **Database Connectivity**: Uses R2DBC for reactive database access
- **RESTful APIs**: Exposes reactive REST endpoints for CRUD operations on master data
- **Modular Design**: Organized into separate modules for clear separation of concerns
- **Catalog-Based Approach**: Uses catalog entities for flexible and configurable reference data
